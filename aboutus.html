                    <h3><u>Department of Computer Engineering</u></h3>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="ap">The Computer Engineering department was established in the year 2001 to impart quality education. The department has well qualified and motivated faculty members and support staff. The laboratories are adequately equipped with state-of-the-art facilities. The students are members of various professional bodies like IET, CSI, IEEE, NSS etc. Various platforms are available for students, like project competition, technical & cultural festivals, international conference, etc. to showcase their talent. It is a regular practice of the department to organize industrial visits, expert talks, workshops and internship in addition to the latest certification courses for students in the field of Computer engineering. Student have won prizes in various national and international level paper presentation, competitions, projectexhibition etc. As the department has good industry interaction and alumni support, students get several opportunities of internship, project guidance, placement and many more.</p>
                    <p class="ap">The department is accredited by NBA in 2018 and intake has doubled to 120 from academic year 2019-20. Besides offering undergraduate (B. Tech. in Computer Engineering) it also offers Post Graduation (M.Tech.) in Artificial Intelligence. As the autonomous status is awarded by UGC from academic year 2021-22, curricula have revised for UG and PG programs by Board of Studies. Exposure courses like Skill based, Activity based and Technology based courses are added to motivate students to participate in various activities. Under Project Based Learning (PBL) mini, minor and major projects are introduced from sem III to Sem VIII which help students to work in a team and develop projects using latest technologies. The department has to its credits of maximum number of placements of the students in Infosys, TCS, Accenture, Cognizant, L&T Infotech, CSC, Tech Mahindra, Mastek, ICON, Majesco, MuSigma, BNP Paribas. Every year, few students opt for pursuing higher studies at prestigious universities in India and abroad.</p>
